## Required dependencies for SimpleHUD

* SimpleHUD ([download here](https://www.lcpdfr.com/downloads/gta5mods/scripts/39944-simplehud/?do=download&confirm=1&csrfKey=08de6971ec52e310a93e4f18b67cbd32))
* ScriptHookVDotNet ([download here](https://github.com/scripthookvdotnet/scripthookvdotnet/releases/download/v3.6.0/ScriptHookVDotNet.zip))
* ScriptHookV ([download here](http://dev-c.com/files/ScriptHookV_1.0.3095.0.zip))
* LemonUI SHVDN3 Version ([download here](https://github.com/LemonUIbyLemon/LemonUI/releases/download/v2.0/LemonUI.zip))
* OpenIV ([download here](https://openiv.com/WebIV/guest.php?get=1))

## ScriptHookVDotNet Installation

Open the downloaded folder and then drag the 
`ScriptHookVDotNet.asi` 
`ScriptHookVDotNet.ini`
`ScriptHookVDotNet2.dll`
`ScriptHookVDotNet3.dll`
to your main GTAV folder

## ScriptHookV Installation

Open the downloaded folder and then drag all the files to your main GTAV folder.
*You dont need to move NativeTrainer if you use your own trainer*

## LemonUI Installation

Open the downloaded folder and then open the SHVDN3 version, then drag all the files to your *scripts* folder, not the main directory.

## OIV File Installation

Open OpenIV then install the `OpenIV.asi` plugin in the ASI manager tab.
This is done because this will create a `mods` folder that you install all your mods to. In case of some mods are crashing, you just have to delete the mods folder or put an `_` before the folder like `_mods` and your game should work nicely.
